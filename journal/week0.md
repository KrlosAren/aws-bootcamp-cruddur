I created my account using the AWS console and attached AdministratorAccess to my account

## Generate AWS Credentials

I had configured credentials in my computer, but with the command aws sts get-caller-identity I get my local configuration

## Install AWS CLI

![Install AWS CLI](../_docs/assets/awsLocal.jpg)

I installed the AWS CLI in the path
```
/usr/local/bin/aws
```

## Creater billing alarm and Create Budget

![Billing alarm](../_docs/assets/dashAlerts.jpg)

I created two billing alarms one for FreeTier of computer EC2 hours and one for ZeroSpendBudget, but this account is shared with other people and the limit was reached

![Limit threshold](../_docs/assets/EC2FreeTier.jpg)

Also, I configured 3 thresholds to send me an email when the limit reached 50% , 75% and 100%.

My budget configuration is 10$ but the limit was reached
